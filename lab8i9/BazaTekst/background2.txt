 Reported rates of ASD have been rising in many countries over the past 2 decades.
 [96, 97]  Epidemiological studies of relatively uncommon conditions such as ASD are expensive. A suitable research strategy is the administration of multiple screenings in a population, each time identifying more likely subjects for detailed investigation. For example, a reporting tool, such as the Autism Screening Checklist, can be distributed to all parents and guardians in a target population. See the image below. The checklist identifies those children with characteristics of an ASD and differentiates them from children with child-onset schizophrenia. (See History). Estimates of the prevalence of ASD suggest that as many as 400,000 individuals in the United States have ASD or a related condition. The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network surveillance system provides estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11 ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). The Network's 2018 report, based on 2014 data, shows the overall prevalence of ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59) children aged 8 years.
 [98]  According to survey results from parents across the United States, 1 in 40 children (2.5%) has ASD, representing an estimated 1.5 million children ages 3 to 17 years
 [99]  an increase from 11 in 1000 in 2007.
 [100]  A global prevalence of 7.6 cases of ASD per 100 (1 in 132) was estimated on review of epidemiological studies.
 [101] ASD and related conditions are estimated to affect up to 10-15 people per 10,000 population worldwide. In a population-based study of all 7- to 12-year-old children (N = 55,266) in a South Korean community, Kim et al estimated that the prevalence of ASD was 2.64%
 [102]  Studies in Japan report much higher rates than are found in other countries.
 [103] Japanese investigators suggest that these findings reflect the careful evaluations performed by Japanese clinicians, which may identify cases that would be overlooked in other countries. Alternatively, ASD may be more common in Japan because of gastrointestinal and other infections transmitted through the ingestion of seafood and other aquatically derived foods that are characteristic of the Japanese diet. Estimates of the prevalence of ASD vary widely by sex. Combining data from all 11 Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network communities, ASD prevalence was 26.6 per 1,000 boys and 6.6 per 1,000 girls (prevalence ratio: 4.0). ASD prevalence was significantly (p< 0.01) higher among boys than among girls in all 11 ADDM sites, with male-to-female prevalence ratios ranging from 3.2 (Arizona) to 4.9 (Georgia).
 [98]  ASD is most common in boys who have the 46,XY karyotype (ie, the normal male karyotype). In some studies, fragile X is reported in approximately 10% males with autistic disorder.
