 TS occurs worldwide, in all social classes and races. Cases meeting current diagnostic criteria have been reported in the United States, Europe, New Zealand, Brazil, Japan, China, and the Middle East. The clinical phenomenology appears similar, regardless of ethnicity or culture, suggesting a common genetic basis. The precise prevalence of TS has been difficult to ascertain, and what once was thought to be a rare condition is now felt to be much more common. Most children with TS have nondisabling symptoms, their tics improve and resolve with age, and they never seek medical attention. As the clinical criteria for the condition has evolved, most investigators believe that the estimated prevalence is 0.7-4.2%, based on observation studies in public schools. In school-based studies, tics were identified in 26% of students in special education programs, compared with 6% of students in mainstream classrooms.
 [9, 10]  The male-to-female ratio varies from 2-10:1. However, if OCD is included as a variant of TS, then the male-to-female ratio is 1:1. Children are much more likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for TS than adults. TS is a childhood-onset condition, and adults who display symptoms of TS are likely to have had the symptoms since childhood. Symptoms of TS can be seen in infancy, but most children with TS display readily identifiable symptoms at around age 7 years. Symptoms resolve by adulthood in most children with TS. Whether this resolution represents a compensatory process or resolution of the underlying pathology is unclear.
