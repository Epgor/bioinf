 Anorexia nervosa is found in all developed countries and in all socioeconomic classes, occurring around the world at similar rates (0.3-1% in women, 0.1–0.3% in men). It is also found in developing countries such as China and Brazil.
 [16, 43]  According to Mehler et al, certain groups are especially at risk for anorexia nervosa, including dancers, long-distance runners, skaters, models, actors, wrestlers, gymnasts, flight attendants, college sorority members, and others for whom thinness is emphasized and overly rewarded.
 [44]  In a European study, a 0.48% lifetime incidence of anorexia nervosa was reported among 21,425 respondents.
 [45]  The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in the United States is estimated to be 0.3–1%; however, some studies have shown rates as high as 4% among women. The rates among men are estimated at 0.1–0.3%. As many as 5% of young women exhibit symptoms of anorexia but do not meet the full diagnostic criteria, and some studies show disordered eating behavior in 13% of adolescent girls in the United States.
 [14, 15, 16, 43]  Using nationally representative, face-to-face interview surveys of 10,123 adolescents in the continental United States, Swanson et al found the following 12-month prevalence rates for eating disorders
 [17] : Anorexia nervosa (0.2%) Bulimia nervosa (0.6%) Binge-eating disorder (1.6%) Subthreshold anorexia nervosa (0.9%) Subthreshold binge-eating disorder (1.1%) Anorexia nervosa is diagnosed more often in the white (>95%) adolescent (>75%) populations
 [46, 47] of the middle and upper socioeconomic classes, although it can be observed in either sex and in people of any race, age, or social stratum. A study of adults in the United States found that, after adjusting for income, lifetime rates of anorexia nervosa were lower for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic respondents than for white respondents.
 [48]  This disorder is probably underdiagnosed in black individuals and males because of a lower index of suspicion.
 [49, 50, 51]  Anorexia nervosa is more common in women than in men, with a female-to-male ratio of 10-20:1 in developed countries. In some professions, however, the frequency is much higher among men (wrestling, running, modeling) than it is in the general male population. Treatment plans remain the same for both sexes. Gay and bisexual males are more likely to have an eating disorder than heterosexual males, but they are also more likely to have bulimia than anorexia.
 [52, 53]  Anorexia nervosa has been observed in both the very young and very old, but the disorder is primarily a phenomenon of puberty and early adulthood. Eighty-five percent of patients have onset of the disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 years (although a survey of adolescents by Swanson et al found a median age of onset of 12.3 y).
 [17, 14, 54] Patients who are older at the time of onset of the disorder have a worse prognosis, as do patients with an onset before age 11 years.
